# Workshop Notebooks ðŸ““

This directory contains the main workshop materials organized as Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“š Notebook Sequence

### 01_agent_from_scratch.ipynb
**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Level**: Beginner

Learn the fundamentals of AI agents by building a ReAct agent from scratch:
- Core Agent class implementation
- Tool function creation and integration
- Manual vs automated execution loops
- Understanding the Thought-Action-Observation pattern

**Prerequisites**: Basic Python, OpenAI API key

### 02_agent_using_langgraph.ipynb  
**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Level**: Intermediate

Build sophisticated agents using the LangGraph framework:
- StateGraph architecture
- Advanced tool integration
- Web search capabilities
- Error handling and robustness

**Prerequisites**: Completion of Lesson 1, Tavily API key

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Ensure your environment is set up (see main README.md)
2. Start with `01_agent_from_scratch.ipynb`
3. Follow the notebooks in sequential order
4. Complete exercises before moving to the next section

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- Run cells sequentially - later cells depend on earlier ones
- Read the markdown explanations carefully
- Experiment with the code - modify parameters and see what happens
- Don't skip the exercises - hands-on practice is essential

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that your `.env` file is properly configured
2. Ensure all packages are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Restart the Jupyter kernel if you modify environment variables
4. Refer to the main README for detailed troubleshooting
